# _Phase One: The Search_

## Search

_I started my pursuit with a general google search. I typed "marketing developer" into the Google search bar which did not give me much. I then decided to search "how to combine marketing and development"._

## What I found from this reading is:

* **Keeping marketing and development separate is common.** This article is written to display why development and marketing should be combined which tells me that separate silos are not knew or unusual.
* **Development and marketing are often considered two separate mindsets.** The issue of keeping marketing and development separate comes down to the isolation of two separate mindsets. Developers ask the questions such as "What features does the user need?" while Marketers ask "How do we position ourselves compared to the competition?". The answer to these questions could certainly be different but they could also be the same. Features created could also be the edge that differentiates business from the competition.
* **In the world filled with unlimited data we should share more of our data points** Another issue with keeping the developers and marketers separate is limited data sharing. Keeping dev teams and marketing teams separate means the only point of shared thoughts/ideas/data would be up to those teams to construct.Both teams are receiving feedback from clients and customers and are being kept as separate conversations and both teams are none the wiser.When I was working in an agency we were constantly looking for people to make sense of data(from campaigns, social media, ads, etc.), anything we could find that would bring a story to our numbers was extremely helpful to us and the client. Data points are helpful in the pursuit of any mission.
* **Collaboration of marketing/development leads to better understanding of both the product and the customer** As described in our prompt today, all tech is problem solving! Tech deals with helping users see things, learn things, do things and buy things. Business has a similar structure! Working in both marketing and development leads to better understanding of what the customer needs, what features to prioritize and a better understanding of the software.
